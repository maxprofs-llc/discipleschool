      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last several years trying to learn as much as possible and put it all together into one big project that I could share with the people. But as I&amp;rsquo;m reading one book, I find that it leads to a dozen more, and I start reading those books - and all the books they reference while I&amp;rsquo;m still reading through the original book that piqued my interest. Obviously, I&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to finish them all.</description>

      <description>I just read that More than half of global population now online: UN
Highlights from the article:
 According to the UN, 3.9 billion people are now using the Internet, meaning that for the first time more than half of the global population is online.
 Land-lines are disappearing, but the number of mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions is now greater than the global population.
 Mobile broadband subscriptions have skyrocketed from just four subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in 2007 to 69.</description>
