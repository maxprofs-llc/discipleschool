      <description>I just read that More than half of global population now online: UN
Highlights from the article:
 According to the UN, 3.9 billion people are now using the Internet, meaning that for the first time more than half of the global population is online.
 Land-lines are disappearing, but the number of mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions is now greater than the global population.
 Mobile broadband subscriptions have skyrocketed from just four subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in 2007 to 69.</description>
