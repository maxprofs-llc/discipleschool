      <description>This article is not really about Chris Pratt. It&amp;rsquo;s about Christianity - the modern form of Christianity that is nothing like the Christianity we read about in the Bible. I could just have easily substituted Pratt&amp;rsquo;s name with Lady Gaga, or virtually any other famous person who claims to love Jesus. Actually, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to use the name of any famous people at all. I could have entitled it, &amp;ldquo;The Christianity of Most Americans,&amp;rdquo; but I think it helps to throw the name of a famous person in there.</description>
