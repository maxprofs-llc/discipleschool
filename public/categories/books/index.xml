      <description>I read and enjoyed the book, Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World, by Adam Grant and Sheryl Sandberg.
The title of this post is taken from the section I want to discuss today: Prisoners of Prototypes. The point of the section is that the more familiar we become with a particular domain or area of life, we tend to become trapped by certain ways of thinking.
We compare every new idea that we encounter against the templates of ideas that have succeeded in the past.</description>
