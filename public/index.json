[{"categories":null,"contents":"Explore and Explain  Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Jason West and I have been studying and teaching the Bible for a couple of decades.\nI have an insatiable curiosity.

I suppose that\u0026rsquo;s what drives me to become a better teacher.\nSo my life is pretty much summed up by those two activities: Explore and Explain.\nAnd this website is where I will try to EXPLAIN the things I EXPLORE.\nWhat You Should Expect  As I read an article recently, I discovered this amazing quote from Thomas J. Watson, the famous chairman and CEO of International Business Machines (IBM):\n\"Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the dangers of controversy. Speak your mind and fear less the label of 'crack-pot' than the stigma of conformity. And on issues that seem important to you, stand up and be counted at any cost.\"  By the time I stumbled across his quote, I was already on the path towards creating this blog and finally publishing my thoughts and ideas about the Bible and other church-related issues. But reading it made me more determined than ever to expose my ideas and speak my mind - in other words, to make this website a reality.\nI\u0026rsquo;m glad you\u0026rsquo;ve decided to stop by. I hope you are challenged by what you encounter here.\nIf you enjoy this sort of content, please share this site with others.\n","summary":"Explore and Explain  Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Jason West and I have been studying and teaching the Bible for a couple of decades.\nI have an insatiable curiosity.

The church has tried to get world evangelization without disciple making.\nBill Hull, The Disciple-Making Pastor (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Revell, 1988)  I\u0026rsquo;m compelled to tell you something that may be difficult for you to hear.\nYour church has a serious problem.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure that you\u0026rsquo;d love to respond by telling me the size of your congregation, the amount of giving, your service to the poor, or the number of new converts.\nBut just for a moment, I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll suppress the urge to become defensive, because I\u0026rsquo;m truly not attacking you, your pastor, your denomination, or your church.\nIn fact, I trust that you have a sincere desire to win the lost and that you invest your time and resources in a variety of activities and programs taking place at your church. But I want you to ask yourself a question, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want you to feel like it\u0026rsquo;s your duty to honor the sacrifice of everyone in your church by instantly responding \u0026ldquo;yes.\u0026rdquo; Seriously ask yourself the question:\n\u0026ldquo;Is my church producing disciples?\u0026rdquo;\nRead that again, and give yourself several seconds to think about it. Are people genuinely being conformed to the likeness of Christ?\nI\u0026rsquo;m not asking if they regularly attend services or if they love the pastor or whether they speak in tongues. I\u0026rsquo;m not asking if they participate in worship or whether they\u0026rsquo;re paying their tithes. Those may all be needful and good. But churches are full of people who do all of those things without being transformed into the likeness of Jesus.\nAs proof, consider the following statistics. They are alarming. They indicate that there is almost no difference between the behavior of Christians and non-Christians.\n Divorce rates are about the same. The percentages of men who regularly view pornography are roughly the same — and it’s a lot of men. Christians are considered to be more than two times as likely to have racist attitudes as non-Christians. Domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse, and most other problems are just as prevalent among Christians as among non-Christians. Consider too statistics about evangelicals. About one in four people living together outside marriage call themselves evangelicals. Sixty to 80 percent of young people will leave the church in their twenties. Fewer than one out of five who claim to be born-again Christians have a worldview of even a few fundamental biblical beliefs.  In fact, after looking at a number of categories of lifestyle and values, George Barna said\nThe fact that the proportion of Christians who affirm these values is equivalent to the proportion of non-Christians who hold similar views indicates how meaningless Christianity has been in the lives of millions of professed believers.\nGreg Ogden, Transforming Discipleship (InterVarsity Press, 2003)  How can it be that the people who claim that they love Jesus and are committed to obeying his teachings are - in nearly every area of life - no different than non-believers?\nAs I mentioned, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to participate in church activities and programs without ever really allowing Jesus Christ to radically change your life and cause you to really become more like him.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time for us to recognize that in spite of weekend services, mid-week services, small group meetings, choir practices, special events, programs and plays, trips, retreats, revivals, conferences, and much more, we are failing at the one thing Jesus commanded of us: make disciples who are also able make more disciples.\nWe must admit that in our pursuit of larger audiences, larger buildings, and larger budgets, we have neglected the real mission of the church. This neglect has resulted in a serious crisis, and how we respond to this crisis is the most important challenge we face today.\nThe crisis at the heart of the church is a crisis of product.\nBill Hull, The Disciple Making Pastor (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Revell, 1988)  Rediscovering the Art of Becoming and Producing Disciples of Jesus Christ As part of my personal response to the current crisis of discipleship, I decided to start this project - Disciple School.\nWhile working on a tagline that would summarize the mission of Disciple School, I originally came up with: “Becoming and Producing Disciples of Jesus Christ.” But as I spent more time thinking about it and trying to clarify it, I came up with “Rediscovering the Art of Becoming and Producing Disciples of Jesus Christ.”\nI still might revise it a bit in the future, but I like the three action words: Rediscovering, Becoming and Producing.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s break the sentence down word-by-word and talk about it.\nRediscovering The great Christian revolutions came not by the discovery of something that was not known before. They happen when someone takes radically something that was always there.\nH. Richard Niebuhr  Rediscovery is defined as: the action or process of discovering again something that was forgotten or ignored (Oxford).\nI chose the word “rediscovering” in order to make it clear that I\u0026rsquo;m not looking to invent something new.\nI have not single-handedly come up with some newer, better way to \u0026ldquo;do church.\u0026rdquo; On the contrary, I\u0026rsquo;m simply trying to rediscover that which has always been available to us, but was somehow forgotten and lost to us for a long time.\nTo look at something as though we had never seen it before requires great courage.\nHenri Matisse  \u0026ldquo;Old is the new new,\u0026rdquo; writes Steven Poole, author of Rethink: The Surprising History of Ideas (Scribner, 2016). Poole insists that ours is \u0026ldquo;an an age of re-discovery. Because surprisingly often, it turns out, innovation depends on old ideas.”\nSo we will explore the \u0026ldquo;old ideas\u0026rdquo; of Jesus, the master disciple-maker. We\u0026rsquo;ll study his methods and techniques for training his disciples. Could it be that those methods are just as divine as his teachings? We will also look into the possible causes for the church\u0026rsquo;s current inability and/or unwillingness to make disciples. How and why did we settle onto this current form of church? What are we allowed to change? Are we even to change if it means greater effectiveness?\nRegardless of how reluctant we may be to accept it, the data is overwhelming clear: we are not currently producing disciples of Jesus. We must accept responsibility for that failure, diligently search the Scriptures for the answers, and be prepared to change - or even completely discard - anything that hinders our disciple-making abilities.\n\u0026hellip;the Art of There are several definitions and uses for the word, \u0026ldquo;art,\u0026rdquo; as in, \u0026ldquo;the art of conversation\u0026rdquo; or, \u0026ldquo;the art of writing.\u0026rdquo;\nArt is defined as \u0026ldquo;a skill at doing a specified thing, typically one acquired through practice\u0026rdquo; (Oxford), or \u0026ldquo;a skill acquired by experience, study, or observation\u0026rdquo; (Merriam-Webster).\nBasically, if you can become better at it, it\u0026rsquo;s considered an art.\nAn art can be any activity in which one can improve her skills by studying, observing or practicing. Becoming a disciple certainly involves all of those activities. In fact, as we discover more about the rabbi-disciple relationship being modeled in Jesus\u0026rsquo; day, it will become clear that those are some of the primary activities required of a disciple. Studying the Scripture. Observing the words and actions of the rabbi. And then putting the rabbi\u0026rsquo;s words and activity into personal practice.\nInterestingly, the Greek word used for “disciple” in the New Testament is “*mathetes*” (pronounced moth-ay-tayce\u0026rsquo;) and its root, “math-“ (as in \u0026ldquo;mathematics\u0026rdquo;) means the “mental effort needed to think something through“. Mathetes is also derived from manthano which \u0026ldquo;carries the connotation of intentional learning by inquiry and observation.\u0026rdquo;\nIn that case, becoming a disciple of another person is, by definition, an art, and making disciples would definitely qualify as an art.\nReferring to discipleship as an art makes clear becoming a disciple is not a passive transformation. It will require intentional effort. Becoming a disciple is hard work. Making disciples is even more difficult.\nBecoming I used “becoming” because it acknowledges the likelihood that we ourselves may not even be disciples.\nIf it is true that the current system is not producing disciples of Jesus, we must be willing to accept the notion that - as products of that broken system - we may have developed some ideas and habits that are actually keeping us from reaching full maturity as disciples. More than that, we may have reached the point where we\u0026rsquo;re no longer even attempting to mature as disciples.\nResearch indicates that fewer than one in five born-again adults have any specific, measurable goals related to their spiritual development.\nIn a nationwide survey, conducted by The Barna Group, hundreds committed Christians were interviewed, including pastors and church leaders. The results of the survey revealed that \u0026ldquo;Not one of the adults we interviewed said that their goal in life was to be a committed follower of Jesus Christ or to make disciples of the entire world-or even their entire block.\u0026rdquo; (Greg Ogden, Transforming Discipleship, InterVarsity Press, 2003)\nWhy is that? Probably because we think of our relationship with Jesus as a passive one, where we simply receive good things from him, like forgiveness from sin, good health and financial blessings. We don\u0026rsquo;t view it as an apprenticeship, where we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to exert energy and apply discipline in an effort to become more like him.\nAnd if we\u0026rsquo;re not truly applying ourselves in order to shape our nature and character into something that resembles Jesus, then how could we possibly be helping others do the same?\nAfter all, one cannot make disciples of Jesus if one has never truly become a disciple - or student - of Jesus.\nA passive recipient is not the same as a devoted disciple. And our current church model has been meticulously designed to create passive recipients.\nProducing Producing disciples of Jesus is the entire purpose of the church. There is absolutely nothing more important than the task of disciple-making.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not enough for us to simply become disciples ourselves - and that task is difficult enough. Jesus also expects us to produce other disciples. I initially wondered if I should omit \u0026ldquo;producing\u0026rdquo; and simply say that we\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;rediscovering the art of becoming disciples.\u0026rdquo; After all, I reasoned, if we actually become true disciples of Jesus, we will - by our very nature - produce other disciples.\nBut then it occurred to me that it is possible to become something without also producing that same something. While there is a tremendous variety in the means by which organisms reproduce themselves, living things typically experience two stages of being or cycles of life. There is the juvenile, or pre-productive stage in which individuals grow and mature. Then there is the adult, or reproductive stage in which individuals are able to produce more instances of their particular organism.\nThe same is true in the area of disciple-making. We first become disciples of Jesus, and then at some point, we reach maturity and are able to produce other disciples. How long should this developmental stage last? I think it\u0026rsquo;s safe to say that it varies from one person to another. But there is no doubt that every disciple should - at some point - reach a level of maturity where they begin producing other disciples.\nDisciples Matthew 28:18-20 contains the most recognizable version of Jesus\u0026rsquo; command to make disciples:\n18 \u0026ldquo;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.\n19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and\n20 teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\u0026rdquo;\nJesus Christ  So what exactly is a disciple? More precisely, what did Jesus mean when he commanded us to fill the earth with disciples? Why did he choose that particular word? What was he trying to convey? That\u0026rsquo;s what we need to figure out so that we can have a clear goal in mind.\nAs long as we\u0026rsquo;re unclear about Jesus\u0026rsquo; concept of a disciple, how can we be sure that we\u0026rsquo;re producing the kind of people Jesus that would regard as disciples?\nIn order to gain a better understanding of what we should be producing, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the first-century concept of discipleship. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll compare Jesus\u0026rsquo; expectations for disciples against what we\u0026rsquo;re actually producing.\nI think it will clear that we are facing a crisis of discipleship.\nIf it is true that the product we are producing in our churches is so far removed from what Jesus clearly intended us to make, may I suggest that we stop and ask ourselves why we should continue pouring resources into a failed system. The solution is to repent, study the Scriptures, pray for direction and work towards an effective strategy for making disciples in our current context.\nOF Jesus Christ In our effort to become and produce disciples, it\u0026rsquo;s essential for us to remember that nobody is just a disciple. They must be a disciple of something or someone.\nDallas Willard asks the question in his classic book, The Divine Conspiracy:\nWhose disciple are you? Honestly. One thing is sure: You are somebody’s disciple. You learned how to live from somebody else. There are no exceptions to this rule... It is hard to come to realistic terms with all this. Today, especially in Western cultures, we prefer to think that we are “our own person.” We make up our own minds. But that is only because we have been mastered by those who have taught us that we do or should do so.\nDallas Willard  Everyone is already in the process of becoming a disciple of someone else and simultaneously making others into disciples of themselves. So who has been teaching you? Who is shaping your thought life? Whose actions are you emulating?\nWillard continues by saying:\nIt is one of the major transitions in life to recognize who has taught us, mastered us, and then to evaluate the results of their teaching. This is a harrowing task, and sometimes we just can't face it. But it can open the door for us to choose other masters, possibly better masters, and one Master above all.\nDallas Willard  Of course, Willard is right. At some point, we should all seriously consider who has mastered us and evaluate the results of their mastery over. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a person or group of people. It may be more likely that we\u0026rsquo;ve been mastered by an idea or a system of thinking. At any rate, it\u0026rsquo;s vitally important that you take an active role in choosing whose ideas will control your life.\nObviously, the goal is for us to become and produce disciples (apprentices) who are under the mastery of Jesus Christ alone.\nConclusion What we’re currently doing isn’t working. It\u0026rsquo;s foolish to pretend that it is. We have allowed ourselves to be defined by habits, methods, and routines that do not - and cannot - produce the results Jesus intended.\nWill we continue devoting ourselves to a model of church that brought us to this moment of abject failure? Or will we finally recognize the need to completely re-examine our beliefs and practices - even our entire lives, for that matter - in the light of Scripture? Given that the stakes are so high, we should be willing to challenge and change any beliefs and practices that may be hindering us from becoming and producing disciples of Jesus.\nThink about this quote from John Stott:\nWe must allow the Word of God to confront us, to disturb our security, to undermine our complacency and to overthrow our patterns of thought and behavior.\nJohn Stott  He also said that what we need is \u0026ldquo;not the uncritical repetition of old traditions, but the willingness to submit every tradition, however ancient, to fresh Biblical scrutiny and, if necessary, reform.\u0026rdquo;\nFor just a moment, consider what he\u0026rsquo;s saying to us in that quote. Stop going through the motions without thinking about their effectiveness. Be willing to submit every tradition to fresh Biblical scrutiny. And if necessary, be willing to change anything your doing, no matter how long you\u0026rsquo;ve been doing it - even if \u0026ldquo;grandpa did it this way\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;ve always done it that way.\u0026rdquo; Are we really willing to do that? Or, are there some things that are \u0026ldquo;off limits?\u0026rdquo; Would you really be willing to start from scratch with a Bible and a blank sheet of paper, surrounded by some committed followers of Jesus, and build a plan to make disciples of your community?\nWhen Bill Hybels and the leaders at Willow Creek conducted a thorough review of their effectiveness as a church, they realized that they had to make significant changes. Hybels said it like this:\nOur dream is that we fundamentally change the way we do church. That we take out a clean sheet of paper and we rethink all of our old assumptions. Replace it with new insights. Insights that are informed by research and rooted in Scripture. Our dream is really to discover what God is doing and how he’s asking us to transform this planet.\nBill Hybels, as quoted by Jim Putman \u0026amp; Bobby Harrington, DiscipleShift (HarperCollins Publishing, 2013)  That\u0026rsquo;s what we need to be: \u0026ldquo;informed by research and rooted in Scripture.\u0026rdquo;\nAs I move forward with generating content for this website - writing articles, recording podcasts and creating videos - the goal is to develop a clear and uncomplicated way to train spiritually mature, fully devoted disciples of Jesus who are able to then make more disciples.\nI hope you\u0026rsquo;ll join me on the journey. Start a dialogue with me. Share your hopes and dreams for a truly Biblical disciple-making community.\n","summary":"The Discipleship Crisis The Great Commission has been worshipped, but not obeyed.

It\u0026rsquo;s called Show Your Work, and I highly recommend it for anyone who\u0026rsquo;s ever wondered aloud, \u0026ldquo;How do I get my stuff out there? How do I get noticed? How do I find an audience?\u0026rdquo;\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a great section in the book called \u0026ldquo;Stock and Flow,\u0026rdquo; where Kleon mentions an article that economist Robin Sloan wrote in 2010. In the article, she mentions the economic concepts of stock and flow. She defines stock as anything having static value - like a specific amount of money in the bank, or a certain number trees in the forest. Flow is a rate of change. For example, fifteen dollars per hour or three thousand toothpicks per day.\nShe then uses those concepts as a metaphor for modern media consumption. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a useful metaphor for anyone interested in developing content or becoming an influencer.\nShe says: Flow is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.\nStock is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.\nRobin Sloan  She goes on to say that the magic formula is to maintain a flow (tweets and posts) while working on your stock (evergreen content) in the background.\nThe Stock and Flow analogy reminded me of something I read about Malcolm Gladwell\u0026rsquo;s process for becoming a best-selling author of category-busting books like The Tipping Point. He obviously gained valuable experience writing articles for the New Yorker magazine, but perhaps more importantly, he was able to explore and develop ideas and content that he would later use in his best-selling books.\nIf we think of those books as his stock, then those articles in the New Yorker would be his flow. (Any of us might feel that having an article published in the New Yorker would be our stock, but this is Malcolm Gladwell we\u0026rsquo;re talking about here.)\nShawn Coyne is an editor at Black Irish Books and the author of The Story Grid. He created a podcast series analyzing the process behind the development of The Tipping Point. In the episode entitled, \u0026ldquo;Out of the Rabbit Hole,\u0026rdquo; he talks about stock and flow, but he uses the Hebrew concepts of \u0026ldquo;kavanah\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;matarah.\u0026rdquo;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s that segment in its entirety: Just before the Israeli military’s blitzkrieg offensive against the allied Arab nations massed at its borders in 1967, the word repeated over and over again on Air Force bases and on the sands of the Sinai was “Kavanah.” Kavanah means grand intention. The Sabras were instructed to remember just one thing when the chaos of combat overwhelmed them: \"Remember the Kavanah.\"\nFor the pilots their global mission was to wipe out Arab airstrips while defending Israeli airspace. If they took care of the airstrips, defending the air space would be a hell of a lot easier…. For the ground troops, it was to keep moving forward…to reach and seize the Suez Canal. Taking the Suez Canal would inevitably lead to international intervention… The United States and the U.S.S.R. would jump into the fray if the canal were at stake. Together, those two missions would add up to Israel’s security…at least until the next mobilization of Arab forces.\nKavanahs are not Matarahs, which are building block objectives. (For us writers Matarahs are daily word counts or scene objectives or outlines).\nKavanahs are the global intention. So when pilots lost course on their way to destroy Arab air bases, they did not panic. They realized that while they would not accomplish the immediate Matarah objective, bombing the specific base they’d been assigned, they could still chip away at the Kavanah by bombing another airstrip in their path.\nShawn Coyne  What Shawn Coyne calls the \u0026ldquo;Kavanah,\u0026rdquo; or global intention, Robin Sloan calls \u0026ldquo;stock.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s the end game that we hope to accomplish. It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;the entity.\u0026rdquo;\nMatarot (plural form of matarah), are the daily objectives, the short-term goals that (ideally) move us towards the kavanah.\nMy kavanah / stock / grand intention is to write a book or make something that helps people become and produce disciples of Jesus Christ. The rough draft of that book can be found here. Updates to that site will be less frequent.\nIn the meantime, I will use this site as a platform for distributing my matarot, building block content. I will repeat myself often, experimenting with different ways of attacking a problem, probing for the most effective arguments, analogies and language that will ultimately be used in the book - my grand intention.\n","summary":"Austin Kleon wrote a great book about creativity and audience-building that I\u0026rsquo;ve read multiple times.
