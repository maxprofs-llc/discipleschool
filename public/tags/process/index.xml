      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last several years trying to learn as much as possible and put it all together into one big project that I could share with the people. But as I&amp;rsquo;m reading one book, I find that it leads to a dozen more, and I start reading those books - and all the books they reference while I&amp;rsquo;m still reading through the original book that piqued my interest. Obviously, I&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to finish them all.</description>
