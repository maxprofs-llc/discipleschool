      <description>I read and enjoyed the book, Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World, by Adam Grant and Sheryl Sandberg.
The title of this post is taken from the section I want to discuss today: Prisoners of Prototypes. The point of the section is that the more familiar we become with a particular domain or area of life, we tend to become trapped by certain ways of thinking.
We compare every new idea that we encounter against the templates of ideas that have succeeded in the past.</description>

      <description>I have already made an effort to convince you that something is broken within the modern western church, and I will continue to share more research and statistics from studies that are being conducted.
I realize that there will be a natural tendency on your part to blindly resist any and all criticisms of the church at large, and you will especially resist any perceived attack on your own particular traditions and way of structuring and conducting church.</description>

      <description>The Discipleship Crisis   The Great Commission has been worshipped, but not obeyed. The church has tried to get world evangelization without disciple making. Bill Hull, The Disciple-Making Pastor (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Revell, 1988)  I&amp;rsquo;m compelled to tell you something that may be difficult for you to hear.
Your church has a serious problem.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure that you&amp;rsquo;d love to respond by telling me the size of your congregation, the amount of giving, your service to the poor, or the number of new converts.</description>
