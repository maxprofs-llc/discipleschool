      <description>Explore and Explain  Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Jason West and I have been studying and teaching the Bible for a couple of decades.
I have an insatiable curiosity. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s almost an obsessive compulsion to mentally explore all sorts of seemingly unrelated subjects and fit all of the knowledge I discover into one unifiedÂ system, or one big picture of reality.
I sometimes get lost in my own little world of theoretical possibilities, seeing everything in terms of how it could be improved, or what it could be turned into.</description>
