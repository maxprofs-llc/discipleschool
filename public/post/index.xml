      <description>Feathers for Worms Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with a parable. One day long ago, over the hot sands of a Middle Eastern country, a white skylark flew in joyous loops about the sky. As she swooped near the earth, she heard a merchant cry out, &amp;ldquo;Worms! Worms! Worms for feathers! Delicious worms!&amp;rdquo; The skylark circled about the merchant, hungry at the mention of worms, but puzzled about what the merchant meant. Seeing that the skylark was interested, the merchant motioned her nearer.</description>

      <description>The Discipleship Crisis The Great Commission has been worshipped, but not obeyed. The church has tried to get world evangelization without disciple making.
Bill Hull, The Disciple-Making Pastor (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Revell, 1988)  I&amp;rsquo;m compelled to tell you something that may be difficult for you to hear.
Your church has a serious problem.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure that you&amp;rsquo;d love to respond by telling me the size of your congregation, the amount of giving, your service to the poor, or the number of new converts.</description>

      <description>Austin Kleon wrote a great book about creativity and audience-building that I&amp;rsquo;ve read multiple times. It&amp;rsquo;s called Show Your Work, and I highly recommend it for anyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever wondered aloud, &amp;ldquo;How do I get my stuff out there? How do I get noticed? How do I find an audience?&amp;rdquo;
There&amp;rsquo;s a great section in the book called &amp;ldquo;Stock and Flow,&amp;rdquo; where Kleon mentions an article that economist Robin Sloan wrote in 2010.</description>
