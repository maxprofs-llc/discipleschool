      <description>I have already made an effort to convince you that something is broken within the modern western church, and I will continue to share more research and statistics from studies that are being conducted.
I realize that there will be a natural tendency on your part to blindly resist any and all criticisms of the church at large, and you will especially resist any perceived attack on your own particular traditions and way of structuring and conducting church.</description>

      <description>The Wrong Approach I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last several years trying to learn as much as possible and put it all together into one big project that I could share with the people. But as I&amp;rsquo;m reading one book, I find that it leads to a dozen more, and I start reading those books - and all the books they reference while I&amp;rsquo;m still reading through the original book that piqued my interest.</description>

      <description>I just read that More than half of global population now online: UN
Highlights from the article:
 According to the UN, 3.9 billion people are now using the Internet, meaning that for the first time more than half of the global population is online.
 Land-lines are disappearing, but the number of mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions is now greater than the global population.
 Mobile broadband subscriptions have skyrocketed from just four subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in 2007 to 69.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Mind the gap&amp;rdquo; is a warning that&amp;rsquo;s posted in the UK subway system. It is a notice for passengers to be mindful of the gap between the platform and the subway car so that they don&amp;rsquo;t trip or injure themselves in some way.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to use the phrase to remind us of another gap we should be mindful of. While it could certainly result in bodily harm to forget about that gap in the UK subway, ignoring this gap could do even greater damage.</description>

      <description>The Discipleship Crisis   The Great Commission has been worshipped, but not obeyed. The church has tried to get world evangelization without disciple making. Bill Hull, The Disciple-Making Pastor (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Revell, 1988)  I&amp;rsquo;m compelled to tell you something that may be difficult for you to hear.
Your church has a serious problem.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure that you&amp;rsquo;d love to respond by telling me the size of your congregation, the amount of giving, your service to the poor, or the number of new converts.</description>

      <title>The &#39;End&#39; Game: End-times &amp; the End of Our Credibility</title>

      <description>Feathers for Worms I&amp;rsquo;m concerned that focusing our attention on &amp;ldquo;end-of-the-world&amp;rdquo; prophecies could bring an end to our credibility. Sharing social media posts about the latest apocalyptic theories from doomsday preachers could cost you more than you realize.
Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with a parable. One day long ago, over the hot sands of a Middle Eastern country, a white skylark flew in joyous loops about the sky. As she swooped near the earth, she heard a merchant cry out, &amp;ldquo;Worms!</description>

      <description>Austin Kleon wrote a great book about creativity and audience-building that I&amp;rsquo;ve read multiple times. It&amp;rsquo;s called Show Your Work, and I highly recommend it for anyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever wondered aloud, &amp;ldquo;How do I get my stuff out there? How do I get noticed? How do I find an audience?&amp;rdquo;
There&amp;rsquo;s a great section in the book called &amp;ldquo;Stock and Flow,&amp;rdquo; where Kleon mentions an article that economist Robin Sloan wrote in 2010.</description>
