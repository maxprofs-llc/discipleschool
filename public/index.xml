      <description>Explore and Explain  Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Jason West and I have been studying and teaching the Bible for a couple of decades.
I have an insatiable curiosity. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s almost an obsessive compulsion to mentally explore all sorts of seemingly unrelated subjects and fit all of the knowledge I discover into one unifiedÂ system, or one big picture of reality.
I sometimes get lost in my own little world of theoretical possibilities, seeing everything in terms of how it could be improved, or what it could be turned into.</description>

      <description>The Discipleship Crisis The Great Commission has been worshipped, but not obeyed. The church has tried to get world evangelization without disciple making.
Bill Hull, The Disciple-Making Pastor (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Revell, 1988)  I&amp;rsquo;m compelled to tell you something that may be difficult for you to hear.
Your church has a serious problem.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure that you&amp;rsquo;d love to respond by telling me the size of your congregation, the amount of giving, your service to the poor, or the number of new converts.</description>

      <description>Austin Kleon wrote a great book about creativity and audience-building that I&amp;rsquo;ve read multiple times. It&amp;rsquo;s called Show Your Work, and I highly recommend it for anyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever wondered aloud, &amp;ldquo;How do I get my stuff out there? How do I get noticed? How do I find an audience?&amp;rdquo;
There&amp;rsquo;s a great section in the book called &amp;ldquo;Stock and Flow,&amp;rdquo; where Kleon mentions an article that economist Robin Sloan wrote in 2010.</description>
