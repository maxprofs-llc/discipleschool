# <em>Becoming and Producing Disciples of Jesus Christ</em>

Hi, my name is Jason West. *Disciple School* is my personal website where I'll be creating content and resources designed to help others become and produce disciples of Jesus Christ.

<!--
Here is a very basic outline for the argument I will be presenting:

- We are failing. (Modern western church IS not making - and CANNOT make - disciples in its current state.)
  - Failure results when results don't meet expectations.
  - To prove our failure, we need to compare Jesus' expectations (make disciples) against our results (average believer).
- What Jesus expected. (What is this thing for?)
  - Define "disciple"
  - "of Jesus" (Who was he? What did he come to do?)
    - change your mind
- What we're producing.
  - Barna stats
- Possible causes for our failure.
  - Spoiler alert: we're the problem.
  - The very beliefs and practices we cling to as part of our identity are the very things causing our failure.
- Our current (failing) process.
  - How did we acquire this process?
    - Ellul - "Subversion of Christianity"
  - Is it sacred? (No.)
  - Can we change it?
- Early church process. (How is it supposed to do that?)

- Confirmation biases.
- Belief acquisition and change.


Humans love stories.
About change.
Protagonist - one who changes.
We are captivated by watching protagonist change.
What if you were the one who needed to change?
How would you react?

Your current "reality" is an illusion.
Things are not as they seem.
This is a world at war.
You have a crucial role to play.
What would it take to convince you?

This is the question that has prompted me to study the Bible for the last twenty years. It's why I created this website.
