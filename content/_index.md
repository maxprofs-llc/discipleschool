  <h2>Is this <strong style="background-color:#dda600; color:black;">&nbsp;<em>REALLY</em>&nbsp;</strong> what Jesus had in mind?</h2>
</div>
{{< /hackcss-alert >}}

That's the foundational question we'll be exploring: Is "this" (modern Christianity, the church at large, the typical Christian...) what Jesus had in mind when he issued the command to make disciples?

What would he have expected of a disciple? What attributes and qualities did he have in mind?

Are we producing those kinds of people today?

It's becoming clear that we aren't. So then, why aren't we? What's preventing us from accomplishing the goal?

Jesus promised to authorize and equip us for the mission. So, how is it that we're failing?

What are we willing to change in order to succeed?
