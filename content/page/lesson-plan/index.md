I'm not writing a book, but I like the concept of starting a project by telling myself the story. I will follow Pratchett's advice and simply walk myself through the argument that I'll present on Disciple School.

I have a difficult time recognizing when a given piece of content is ready to be published. For some reason, I have a difficult time publishing small chunks of information about any given subject. I tend to want an exhaustive summary of that subject before presenting it publicly. As a result, I spend a great deal of time collecting information, and not nearly enough time creating content.

I'm trying to get myself past that by forcing myself into a publishing schedule, which will require me to publish things way before I think they're ready.

I'll start posting articles on here in small chunks, and allow the final version to develop over time. I wrote a post about the concept called [learning in public](../../post/learning-in-public), I just never implemented it.

I don't really have an editorial calendar in place, but I do have a roadmap of subjects that I will be addressing. Rather than completing them in some linear order, I'll start adding to them piece by piece and allow them to develop over time.


**Here's a list of posts that I'm currently working on:**

It's my opinion that Christianity is failing. But it's not just an opinion. I can prove it.

Define 'failure.'

Variables contributing to our failure.

Commented out until I have a decent amount of content.
The links point to articles that are still designated as drafts.

- How to create anything (Collect, Curate, Connect, Collate)
- We are failing
- What?! How can that be?
- Why isn't it more obvious? (we've accepted smaller non-essential indicators of success)
- Confirmation Biases

Ultimately, we disciples of Jesus are communicators. Just as Jesus came to "testify of the Truth," we too are supposed to communicate Truth, or Reality, to the world. John the Revelator wrote that believers overcome Satan by the "word of their testimony." I know that many of us who grew up in church have a certain scene in mind when we think of testimonies. Somone - usually an elderly person - stands up and declares something God has done to benefit them recently. Oftentimes, it may involve something that would not be shared in public - but this is testimony service, and we overcome through our testimony... But our testimony is actually our personal account of Reality as we have experienced it. It is our presentation of the gospel - who Jesus is, what he has accomplished for us, etc... And that testimony becomes more effective as we collect more information and experiences where we tests and prove the claims of Jesus.

I have been collecting information for the past few decades.

I've been trying to find the right application that could serve as my "second brain" or "exocortex."

I've used Evernote, Simplenote, Zettelkasten, QOwnNote... I use 3x5 index cards, notebooks,

You need to create a sort of "bank of ideas." You cannot make withdrawals until you first make deposits.
