Ultimately, we disciples of Jesus are communicators. Just as Jesus came to "testify of the Truth," we too are supposed to communicate Truth, or Reality, to the world. John the Revelator wrote that believers overcome Satan by the "word of their testimony." I know that many of us who grew up in church have a certain scene in mind when we think of testimonies. Somone - usually an elderly person - stands up and declares something God has done to benefit them recently. Oftentimes, it may involve something that would not be shared in public - but this is testimony servive, and we overcome through our testimony... But our testimony is actually our personal account of Reality as we have experienced it. It is our presentation of the gospel - who Jesus is, what he has accomplished for us, etc... And that testimony becomes more effective as we collect more information and experiences where we tests and prove the claims of Jesus.

You need to create a sort of "bank of ideas." You cannot make withdrawals until you first make deposits.
