Christinity is failing. I've been thinking about how to have conversations with other Christians about that fact.

I wonder if other Christians have ever taken a moment to step back from their routines in order to engage in some self-reflection. Have they ever looked at their own church, or the church at large in order to compare it against the Scriptures to see how the church measures up to what we find in the Bible.
