I just read that [More than half of global population now online: UN](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/more-half-global-population-now-115946999.html)

Highlights from the article:

* According to the UN, 3.9 billion people are now using the Internet, meaning that for the first time more than half of the global population is online.

* Land-lines are disappearing, but the number of mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions is now greater than the global population.

* Mobile broadband subscriptions have skyrocketed from just four subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in 2007 to 69.3 today.

* There are currently a full 5.3 billion active mobile broadband subscriptions worldwide.

* Nearly the entire world population, a full 96 percent, now lives within reach of a mobile cellular network, and 90 percent of people can access the Internet through a 3G or higher speed network.


Whenever I hear stats like these, I can't help but think about the amazing opportunities to share the gospel. There are almost 4 billion people using the internet! What would the Apostle Paul have done if he could've communicated with 4 billion people with such little difficulty? What could you and I be doing to reach the masses?

* Start a blog. There are lots of free options:
  * [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org)
  * [Wix](http://www.wix.com)
  * [Medium](http://www.medium.com)
  * [Weebly](http://www.weebly.com)

* Or you could simply post some content on your social media account. Facebook still has a huge audience. Or you could s try to start an account on social networking sites that are popular in other countries, and try to connect with people.

* Start accounts on video sharing sites and make some content. [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) is still king when it comes to video. But other options include [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com) and [Twitch](http://www.twitch.com).
