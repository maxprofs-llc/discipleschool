Is this really what Jesus intended?

this (what we're currently experiencing) vs. what Jesus intended

If what we're experiencing is ***not*** what Jesus intended, then we must conclude that we have failed. After all, that's one way that can be used to determine failure - by comparing results against expectations.

So we'll divide this into three sections:

1. This = what we're doing, and the results
2. What Jesus intended
3. How to transition "this" into what Jesus intended

Christianity is failing.

You may disagree. But this isn't a matter of opinion. I can prove it.

Failure can be demonstrated by answering two questions:

1. What's this thing for?
2. How's it supposed to do that?

First, what is it that we're supposed to be doing? What should be the end result of Christianity? Is there something we should be producing?

We don't have to guess about that. Jesus makes his expectations very clear:

- Disciples (of Jesus)
- Unity
- Rapid Expansion (mustard and leaven)
- Far reach (all people groups)


Secondly, we have to ask how we're supposed to be accomplishing that task. The Bible gives us some clear instructions about what we need to do in order to accomplish the goal.

There may be cases where the goal itself is that we would follow certain instructions - regardless of the outcome. In that case, our lack of success could not be considered a failure, since following the instructions of Jesus would be the mission.

But in our case, following Jesus' instructions would lead to certain results. If we don't see those results, we should come to the realization that we are not following his instructions.

No system is failing. It is doing exactly what it is designed to do. You don't need to fix the system. You need a different system.

I'm suggesting that we're getting exactly what we're designed to get. The church is producing just what it is designed to produce.

"No it isn't. After all, our church (random achievement)."
No matter what you're measuring at your church, the only way to determine failure is to compare expectations against results. We need to compare Jesus' expectations against our results.

"But, we can't control outcomes. All we can do is obey the Bible."
That would imply that our practices are biblical. Let's examine them...
