Imagine you're standing at the edge of a deep gorge. There is a bridge before you, and a person on the bridge urging you to join them in crossing the bridge. They've made it clear that it's not safe to stay on this side of the canyon. Your only escape is to cross the bridge to safety.

They assure you that the bridge is reliable. "Trust me," they say. "You have nothing to worry about. I can guarantee that this bridge can hold us. Thousands of people have used this bridge. I promise, it will never fail you."

You have no reason to doubt them, but you still want to be sure it can hold you. You take one cautious step onto the bridge, and then another before stomping a few times with your foot and bouncing slightly, just to test the bridge for yourself. You want to see if their are any signs of instability.

Suddenly, the person who is already well on their way across the bridge begins to shout, "Whoa! Hey! Please stop!" Startled, you look up to see them gripping a handrail with one hand while frantically waving the other. "No... Don't do that!"

Now you're genuinely puzzled. They just finished telling you how secure the bridge is. So, why are they concerned about a bit of stomping and bouncing? After all, if that small amount of movement could bring the bridge down, ***shouldn't we be concerned***?

After their frantic response to your attempt to test the bridge, you're now more reluctant to step out any further and trust it with your life. Curiously

How can they have such confidence in this bridge, yet ***at the same time*** be so concerned about testing it? Given their concerns about testing the bridge, how can they really expect others to confidently step out onto it?

You're asking me to trust my life to a bridge that you're not willing to jump on!?



<!--
Analogy about faith being like a bridge. Current believers standing on the bridge and inviting others to join them. But when the others want to test the bridge for stability by bouncing on it a little before fully committing, the believers shout 'No! No! Don't do that!' - Do you think that causes the potential bridge-truster to feel more confident about walking out onto the bridge? Or less confident?

If we really believe that Christianity is the Truth - capital 'T'. Then we should encourage others to test it thoroughly. Jump on the bridge. It will not fail.

Encouraging questions will result in others' having more confidence in what we're teaching. If questions scare or offend you, it's probably because you're not doing the work of finding the answers to questions that others may ask.
