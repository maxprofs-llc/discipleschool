This will not interest most of you. But I wanted to include some technical info about the site.

<!--more-->

I use the [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) to create the posts and pages.

The site is built using the blazing fast, open-source static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I moved from Wordpress because it just seemed so cumbersome for my needs. Hopefully, I'll be able to simply focus on writing stuff instead of constantly updating plug-ins.
